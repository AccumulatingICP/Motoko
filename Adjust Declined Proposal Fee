## Objective\n\n 
This proposal aims to adjust the fee associated with a declined proposal to the MOTOKO DAO from 0.25 MOTOKO to an inflation-adjusted value of 2500 MOTOKO. Additionally, it proposes to increase the transaction fee from 0.0001 MOTOKO to 1 MOTOKO, and set the minimum neuron stake to 1 MOTOKO.\n\n 
## Why this is important\n\n 
The purpose of this proposal is to ensure the SNS parameters maintain their ratio in relation to the token split, and to prevent spam by enforcing a minimum stake for neurons.\n\n 
## What is asked of the community\n\n 
- Engage in the governance discussion, ask questions, and provide feedback\n\n 
- Continue to actively vote on proposals & participate in the DAO\n\n 
- Promote responsible participation & use of tools\n\n 
- Monitor for potential adverse outcomes\n\n
