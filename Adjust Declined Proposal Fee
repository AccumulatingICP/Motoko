## Objective\n\n 
This proposal aims to adjust the penalty associated with a declined proposal to the MOTOKO DAO from 0.25 MOTOKO to an inflation-adjusted value of 2500 MOTOKO, which is then suggested to face a 20% reduction, resulting in a total Declined Proposal Penalty of 2000 MOTOKO.\n\n 
## Why this is important\n\n 
The purpose of this proposal is to incentivize user participation, innovation, and the introduction of new ideas within the DAO, while also ensuring a deflationary aspect is maintained and proposals are well-considered.\n\n 
## Pros\n\n 
- Encourages participation & innovation within the DAO\n\n 
- Provides an opportunity for smaller holders to put forth proposals without financial constraints\n\n 
## Cons\n\n 
- Opens the risk to spam proposals\n\n 
- Higher proposal frequency increases the amount of time neurons must spend voting\n\n 
- May lead to the reinstatement of higher MOTOKO declined proposal fees\n\n 
## Security concerns \n\n 
- Reduces the perceived security threshold if a substantial portion of neurons remain low timeframe stakes\n\n 
## What is asked of the community\n\n 
- Engage in the governance discussion, ask questions, and provide feedback\n\n 
- Continue to actively vote on proposals & participate in the DAO\n\n 
- Promote responsible participation & use of tools\n\n 
- Monitor for potential adverse outcomes\n\n
