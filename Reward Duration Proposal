## Objective\n\n 
This proposal reduces the Reward Duration from 8 years to 4 years.\n\n 
## Why This is Important\n\n 
This is important to remain within defined inflationary factors, ensuring the inflationary schedule is maintained.\n\n 
## Background\n\n 
We can explore the effects of this feature before its implementation by examining potential situations that could occur with MOTOKO going forward:\n\n 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LiOCqUmSVm6bMaoDmg6dhX9U2QGtVSeLhzc_l4ELoZ0/edit?usp=sharing\n\n 
## Pros\n\n 
- Manages inflation mechanism.\n\n 
- Maintains DAO security & stability.\n\n 

## Cons\n\n 
- Declining reward schedules may deter later participants.\n\n 
- Potential demand for a new reward structure once the proposed schedule concludes.\n\n 
## What is Asked of the Community\n\n 
- Engage in the governance discussion, ask questions, and provide feedback. Refer to the spreadsheet.\n\n 
- Participate in the proposal process and provide your input on potential inflation rates.\n\n
