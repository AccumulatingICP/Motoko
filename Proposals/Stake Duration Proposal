## Objective\n\n 
This proposal sets out with the objective to increase the active stake duration of MOTOKO from 1 week to 1 month, and in turn, scale voting power linearly across this timeframe, from 1 to 2 VP.\n\n 
## Why this is important\n\n 
Longer stake durations encourage deeper engagement from DAO members, fostering a more stable and committed governance structure. By tying increased voting power to extended staking periods, the DAO rewards participants who are willing to make longer-term contributions to the ecosystem, aligning incentives for both governance and token utility.\n\n 
## Pros\n\n 
- Incentivizes longterm commitment & participation\n\n 
- Improves quality of governance with increased skin in the game\n\n 
- Aligns voting power with long term neurons\n\n 
## Cons\n\n 
- Decreased liquidity accompanies increased stake durations\n\n 
- Has the potential to reduce appeal for short term stakes\n\n 
## Security concerns \n\n 
- Reduces the perceived security threshold if a substantial portion of neurons remain low timeframe stakes\n\n 
## What is asked of the community\n\n 
- Engage in the governance discussion, ask questions, and provide feedback\n\n
- Determine whether the proposed increased maximum stake duration aligns with something you can personally commit to\n\n 
- Continue informed participation in MOTOKO governance, ensuring newfound voting power is utilized\n\n 
- Assist in the communication of increased stake durations, and join our commitment to longterm growth\n\n
